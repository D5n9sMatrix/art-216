    # Applications
    #
    # Two main applications for the struct module exist, data interchange between Python and C code
    # within an application or another application compiled using the same compiler (native formats),
    # and data interchange between applications using agreed upon data layout (standard formats).
    # Generally speaking, the format strings constructed for these two domains are distinct.
    # Native Formats
    #
    # When constructing format strings which mimic native layouts, the compiler and machine architecture
    # determine byte ordering and padding. In such cases, the @ format character should be used to specify
    # native byte ordering and data sizes. Internal pad bytes are normally inserted automatically. It is
    # possible that a zero-repeat format code will be needed at the end of a format string to round up
    # to the correct byte boundary for proper alignment of consecutive chunks of data.
    #
    # Consider these two simple examples (on a 64-bit, little-endian machine):

    # Standard Formats
    #
    # When exchanging data beyond your process such as networking or storage, be precise.
    # Specify the exact byte order, size, and alignment. Do not assume they match the native
    # order of a particular machine. For example, network byte order is big-endian, while many
    # popular CPUs are little-endian. By defining this explicitly, the user need not care about
    # the specifics of the platform their code is running on. The first character should typically
    # be < or > (or !). Padding is the responsibility of the programmer. The zero-repeat format
    # character won’t work. Instead, the user must explicitly add 'x' pad bytes where needed.
    # Revisiting the examples from the previous section, we have:

# This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes objects.
# Compact format strings describe the intended conversions to/from Python values. The module’s
# functions and objects can be used for two largely distinct applications, data exchange with
# external sources (files or network connections), or data transfer between the Python application
# and the C layer.
#
# Note
#
# When no prefix character is given, native mode is the default. It packs or unpacks data based on
# the platform and compiler on which the Python interpreter was built. The result of packing a given
# C struct includes pad bytes which maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly,
# alignment is taken into account when unpacking. In contrast, when communicating data between
# external sources, the programmer is responsible for defining byte ordering and padding between
# elements. See Byte Order, Size, and Alignment for details.
#
# Several struct functions (and methods of Struct) take a buffer argument. This refers to objects
# that implement the Buffer Protocol and provide either a readable or read-writable buffer. The
# most common types used for that purpose are bytes and bytearray, but many other types that can
# be viewed as an array of bytes implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled
# without additional copying from a bytes object.
