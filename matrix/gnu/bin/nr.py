# Applications
#
# Two main applications for the struct module exist, data interchange between Python and C code
# within an application or another application compiled using the same compiler (native formats),
# and data interchange between applications using agreed upon data layout (standard formats).
# Generally speaking, the format strings constructed for these two domains are distinct.
# Native Formats
#
# When constructing format strings which mimic native layouts, the compiler and machine architecture
# determine byte ordering and padding. In such cases, the @ format character should be used to specify
# native byte ordering and data sizes. Internal pad bytes are normally inserted automatically. It is
# possible that a zero-repeat format code will be needed at the end of a format string to round up
# to the correct byte boundary for proper alignment of consecutive chunks of data.
#
# Consider these two simple examples (on a 64-bit, little-endian machine):

class _art1(argparse):
    def __init__(self):
        self.art1_afternoon = None
        self.art1_morning = None
        self.art1_night = None
        self.art1_pier = None
        self.art1_int = None

    def AppNight(self, data=int, pier=1234567890, night=365):
        self.art1_int = data.__name__
        self.art1_pier = pier.__eq__(x=object)
        self.art1_night = night.denominator

    def AppMorning(self, data=int, pier=1234567890, morning=365):
        self.art1_int = data.__name__
        self.art1_pier = pier.__eq__(x=object)
        self.art1_morning = morning.denominator

    def AppAfternoon(self, data=int, pier=1234567890, afternoon=365):
        self.art1_int = data.__name__
        self.art1_pier = pier.__eq__(x=object)

# Standard Formats
#
# When exchanging data beyond your process such as networking or storage, be precise.
# Specify the exact byte order, size, and alignment. Do not assume they match the native
# order of a particular machine. For example, network byte order is big-endian, while many
# popular CPUs are little-endian. By defining this explicitly, the user need not care about
# the specifics of the platform their code is running on. The first character should typically
# be < or > (or !). Padding is the responsibility of the programmer. The zero-repeat format
# character wonâ€™t work. Instead, the user must explicitly add 'x' pad bytes where needed.
# Revisiting the examples from the previous section, we have:
