# This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes objects.
# Compact format strings describe the intended conversions to/from Python values. The moduleâ€™s
# functions and objects can be used for two largely distinct applications, data exchange with
# external sources (files or network connections), or data transfer between the Python application
# and the C layer.
#
# Note
#
# When no prefix character is given, native mode is the default. It packs or unpacks data based on
# the platform and compiler on which the Python interpreter was built. The result of packing a given
# C struct includes pad bytes which maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly,
# alignment is taken into account when unpacking. In contrast, when communicating data between
# external sources, the programmer is responsible for defining byte ordering and padding between
# elements. See Byte Order, Size, and Alignment for details.
#
# Several struct functions (and methods of Struct) take a buffer argument. This refers to objects
# that implement the Buffer Protocol and provide either a readable or read-writable buffer. The
# most common types used for that purpose are bytes and bytearray, but many other types that can
# be viewed as an array of bytes implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled
# without additional copying from a bytes object.
